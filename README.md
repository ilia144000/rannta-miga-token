## 🔒 Security

MIGA is the first Jetton on TON to implement the **Smart Transfer Guard™**, which checks recipient addresses before each transfer to prevent:
- Sending tokens to wallets that cannot receive Jettons
- Sending to contracts or blacklisted addresses
- Human mistakes resulting in lost tokens

This unique feature brings a new level of protection and user confidence to the TON ecosystem.

## 🌍 Symbolism & Inspiration

- **Cyrus Cylinder**: Known as the first human rights charter in history  
- **Griffin**: Mythological guardian, symbol of wisdom, protection, and vision  
- **Olive Branch**: Universal symbol of peace and reconciliation  
- **Persian Cuneiform (𐏃𐎹𐎠)**: Means "Peace" (Solh)

> The design honors Iran’s ancient spirit, while inviting the global crypto community to join in a project of unity and rebirth.
